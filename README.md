print("Hello World")

When we start at the very beginning, we start with the Hello World Program. This repository contains the Junos OS version of that with a simple example pulling either Get Facts or the "show system information". 

These are the languages or tools which can currently be found in this repository:
- Ansible
- Perl
- PyEZ
- Python

These are additional examples which should be added:
- PHP
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Go
- Saltstack

Please help!
