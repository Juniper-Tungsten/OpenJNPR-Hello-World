print("Hello World")

When we [start at the very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEodUg43Zpo), we start with the Hello World Program. This repository contains the Junos OS version of that with a simple example pulling either Get Facts or the "show system information". 

These are the languages or tools which can currently be found in this repository:
- [Ansible](https://github.com/Juniper/ansible-junos-stdlib)
- [Perl](https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-perl)
- [PyEZ](https://github.com/Juniper/py-junos-eznc)
- [Python](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient)

These are additional examples which should be added:
- [PHP](https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-php)
- [Java](https://github.com/Juniper/netconf-java)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/Juniper/net-netconf)
- [Go](https://github.com/Juniper/go-netconf)
- Saltstack
- [RubyEZ](https://github.com/Juniper/ruby-junos-ez-stdlib)

Please help!
